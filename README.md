# DATA550_FinalProject Alzheimer's Disease Analysis
Welcome~~ 
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing Alzheimer's disease data.
** I also upload the output file and plots as well. (Just in case you encounter any problems when you run my code locally on your end.) :) 

## Dataset

- Since it is a rather big dataset file, Github doesn't allow me to upload it straight in CVS format. 
I upload it as a zip file, please feel free to unzip it. 

OR

- You can download it straight from the Kaggle website:

3. Run the command `make all` to execute the analysis and generate the report.
4. The generated report will be saved as `report/report.html`.
