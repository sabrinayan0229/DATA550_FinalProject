# Final Project Alzheimer's Disease Analysis
Welcome~~ 
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing Alzheimer's disease data. <br />
** I also upload the output file and plots as well. (Just in case you encounter any problems when you run my code locally on your end.) :) 

## Dataset

- Since it is a rather big dataset file, Github doesn't allow me to upload it straight in CVS format. <br />
I upload the first 1000 rows dataset file, it might alter the result but I uploaded the orgihnal output report. 

OR

- You can download it straight from the Kaggle website: <br />
